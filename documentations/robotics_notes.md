# robotics notes Team#86 Resistance

---


## Season of 2024: Crescendo

**Talahasee: Mar 17 to 19, 2024 (T,F,S)**
 * Team 118, Robonauts was extra-ordinary!
 * we had issues with software configurations??
 * carpet sepcifications were different?
 * we needed last minute tweaks to get robot working to a standard

**Orlando: Mar 21 to 23, 2024 (T,F,S)**
 * Team 186, Resistance went full steam! reached semi-finals; had impressive performance
 * Team 86 reached "Lower Bracket - Round 5 - Match 13" and we were in Alliance 4.
 * target: we need to be in Alliance 1 or 2; these are usually made up of top ranking teams
 * competing team who won were again extra ordinary: Aliance 1(59, 179) Alliance 2(180,774)
 * the winning alliance won marginally

### Lessons learned from both sessions
 * to be captured

### need for one more full time software engineer volunteer on the team

**what is the ask?**
 * full time commitment during the full season and beyond 
 * absolute crunch time: Jan 1st till March end. M-T: 5pm till 10pm; S-S: 1pm - 10pm
 * ramp up time for new team: Sep/ Oct till Dec: frequency? time-expectations?
 * extra -- summer time season: frequency? time-expectations?
 * approximate time commitment: 1500 - 1800 hours in total
 * roles to include full ownership of software/ codebase; 
 * role-play: wear these hats: developer, analyst, QA/tester, architect, project-manager/ scrum-master
 * fluent collaboration with engineering team designing hardware is key
 * maintain documentation at each step; publish, make visible to team
 * programming language: Java 17? 
 * essentials: machine automation programming; programming to the devidce-drivers for motors, levers, arm moment, etc
 * hardware design and component selection is fluid and evolving; so as the new hardware is chosen; software engineer need to ramp up to the programming of new device-driver from time to time
 * software programming follows the hardware design in sequence
 * the framewwork of the entire project can be re-used from previous year to ascelerate development

 **what options do we have?**
 * to be documented
