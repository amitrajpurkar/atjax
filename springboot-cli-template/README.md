### references
Spring Initializer generates a [very good markdown by default](./HELP.md)
NOTE: this is set to be ignored by GIT
to expose it, you need to take it off the "gitignore" file
Also NOTE, that HELP.md stays as an file checked into your repo; you actually require a README.md file that works as you index documentation by default on github
